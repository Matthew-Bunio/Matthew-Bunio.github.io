                <h2>SSL and TLS</h2>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                 <p> SSL Stands for Secure Sockets Layer, this is security system that creates a protocol that creates a encrypted link between the website URL and the browser. Big corporations will need to have this on their site to keep their own and their customers information private and assessable to outside or unwanted viewers. Comparing this information on SSL to the newer and better TLS though will prove different results. For starters yes, SSL can still be used to this day but TLS provides a better use of encryption to make it so you are now able to send over things such as passwords or credit card information in a safer manner because while SSL encrypts all of your information TLS uses implicit connections making it overall better than SSL.

                  <b>Security</b> 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  One of the main ways to tell that your website that you are making or the website that you are visiting is secure is by looking at the URL if the start of the URL says HTTP it is secure but if it says HTTPS, it is then being secured by SSL making it safer. And yes these do matter because on one end of the spectrum yes it may secure your information of the time being and on the other side of the spectrum there is a much safer and secure way to have all of your information saved and secured.

                  <b>What to Look out for</b>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Something you should also look for when choosing a website is encryption because this is what computers and devices use to hide your information that is being sent out to say a co worker. The main reason that you want to look out for this is so you know that the website is secure, so you are safe to put your information into the website like your card details if you are going to purchase something off the site like amazon. When putting your information some of the things that you should only input on the website if you know that it is secure include your banking details, phone number, passwords and email.

                <h2>What is CSS and Html</h2>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                 <p> Html are two coding languages that are primarily used for web development while the html is used to put the actual wording and text onto the website, CSS is used to style the whole website such as the text size, color, placements of things or add photos and videos in the background. These are both very useful and much needed to provide a functional website or build.

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                   
                  
  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  Focusing on html or Hypertext Markup Language this is a set of words, symbols or phrases that are put together to create what is known  as code which then makes it so stuff like websites are able to be on the internet. Getting More into specifics about certain bits of code something that you will always need are html elements an example of this would be these lines of code show where the wording or information will appear on the website. More choices to add on your code would be html tags and attributes an example of a tag would be this makes it so the code can actually function while an attribute would be something like <p></p> which makes it where you can put your information. Lastly there are block and inline elements these are mainly used with <div></div> being a block and being a inline, a block element is used to create a whole new block of code to put information in while a inline element could be as simple as just adding code to bold a word.
                  <br>

                  <br>
                   
                  
                 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Moving on to CSS One of the primary things to follow when building  a line of CSS is the CSS rule. This is a rule that states when you are trying to target more than one thing you should set these up in a group to make it easier. You are able to complete this by using a CSS selector such as CSS class because when you have this used infront of everything that you want it makes it so you only have to style one thing. Lastly one more thing to know are CSS values these are used when styling lines of code whether from making to size of a photo using width: 120px; or changing the colour using background-colour: red;

After that you can load into the main games and enjoy.

                   <br>
                   <br>
                 <p>In this article, we are going to be going over the basics of how to carve a pumpkin using a step-by-step method and also tell you the tools that you are going to need to get the best results.
                  For this specific article, I'm going to be showing you have to carve the pumpkin that is shown in the image under this body of text, now letâ€™s begin. 
                  



                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                   
                  
  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Step 1</b>
                  <br>
                  To start, we are going to try and find the best pumpkin for the carving.Look for a pumpkin that is fresh, with no bruises, and has a flat bottom.  These are all used to ensure the best jack-o-lantern
                  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Step 2</b>
                  
                  Next you should have a knife and cut a hole in the top of the pumpkin. This should be big enough to get your whole arm in the hole.

                  
                 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>step 3</b>
                  <br>
                  Next you should grab a spoon and start scooping out all of the innards from the pumpkin and put them in a place that won't be a bother to you. Keep scooping until the pumpkin is hollow.
                  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>step 4</b>
                  <br>
                  Afteryou have hollowed the pumpkin out, you can trace the design on the pumpkin either by drawing on it with a marker or dotting holes in the pumpkin in the outline of the shape.
                  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>step 5</b>
                  <br>
                  After that, grab your knife again and start cutting through the pumpkin following either the dotted or traced lines until the shape is cut out and you can see in the pumpkin.
                  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>step 6</b>
                  <br>
                  Lastly, put the top back on the pumpkin, also (this is optional) you can get a candle and put in the pumpkin so that when you set it out at night it will glow.


                  Now that you are able to carve a simple pumpkin you can try using these steps to carve more complex designs.  Just remember to take your time and Happy Halloween!

                 <h2>Why I got into Software Development</h2>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                  <p>Hi, this will be a short summary on why i chose to get into ptec and later down the line choose to go into the software development stream.
 
                   <br>
                   <br>

                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <b>Ptec</b>
                  
I feel that the main reason i wanted to go into ptec was because in my middle school and junior high i was always curious about the block coding toy lego mindstorms and this fueled my passion more when i discovered that i was able to take a step forward into coding more with website and game building

                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <b>Mitt</b>
                   The reason i feel that i chose software development in mitt was because during the first couple years that i had a highschool and ptec i realised that i enjoy building and making websites and games more than i did with learning about stuff like firewalls.
