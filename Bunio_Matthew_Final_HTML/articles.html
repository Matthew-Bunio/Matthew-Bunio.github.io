                <h2>SSL and TLS</h2>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                 <p> SSL Stands for Secure Sockets Layer, this is security system that creates a protocol that creates a encrypted link between the website URL and the browser. Big corporations will need to have this on their site to keep their own and their customers information private and assessable to outside or unwanted viewers. Comparing this information on SSL to the newer and better TLS though will prove different results. For starters yes, SSL can still be used to this day but TLS provides a better use of encryption to make it so you are now able to send over things such as passwords or credit card information in a safer manner because while SSL encrypts all of your information TLS uses implicit connections making it overall better than SSL.

                  <b>Security</b> 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  One of the main ways to tell that your website that you are making or the website that you are visiting is secure is by looking at the URL if the start of the URL says HTTP it is secure but if it says HTTPS, it is then being secured by SSL making it safer. And yes these do matter because on one end of the spectrum yes it may secure your information of the time being and on the other side of the spectrum there is a much safer and secure way to have all of your information saved and secured.

                  <b>What to Look out for</b>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Something you should also look for when choosing a website is encryption because this is what computers and devices use to hide your information that is being sent out to say a co worker. The main reason that you want to look out for this is so you know that the website is secure, so you are safe to put your information into the website like your card details if you are going to purchase something off the site like amazon. When putting your information some of the things that you should only input on the website if you know that it is secure include your banking details, phone number, passwords and email.
